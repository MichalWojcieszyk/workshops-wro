RoR Workshops
================
Hello! This is my solution to Netguru Ruby on Rails challenge which is the way to qualify for their workshops in Wroclaw, December 2015.

[Here](https://github.com/netguru-training/wroclaw-ror-workshops-2015-december?utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=23925226&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_otQAyBnRNOQD00e3ic-xg0qPxJst1mG379wDnEDhhmMexLDa5vL0kDnrag409P2VyVdm_GNifRBXkS_OG7RrTBH8G2w&_hsmi=23925226) you can find original repo with tasks.

[And here](http://still-stream-1472.herokuapp.com/) is my solution uploaded on Heroku.

How I deal with the additional payment task? I chose simple solution that admin can add payment to a particular student (for selected month and it is 100 euro per month) and than he will be able to see them on payments#index and for particular student on students#show.
